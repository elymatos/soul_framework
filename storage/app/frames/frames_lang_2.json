        "description": "Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The #Unit (e.g. <m>Tuesday<\/m>) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal #Whole (Tuesday <m>of next week<\/m>), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a #Relative_time (<m>next<\/m> Tuesday).\n<ex>Jo's mother will visit on [this coming|Relative_time] [[Tuesday|Target]|Unit].<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\nVery frequently, the #Whole or #Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the #Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the #Relative_time is DNI.\n\n<ex>On [[April|Unit]|Target] 2 , she finally found her mother .

[INI|Whole] <\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\nWords of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs #Landmark_period and #Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following:\n<ex>[Last|Relative_time] [[Tuesday|Unit]|Target] she said I 'd have to come back .<\/ex>\n<ex>[Last [Tuesday|Target]|Landmark_period] [she said I 'd have to come back|Trajector_event] .<\/ex>\nWe do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like <m>on<\/m>, <m>in<\/m>, <m>at<\/m>, <m>before<\/m>, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a #Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE #Trajector_event is lexically specific.\n<ex><\/ex>\nThere are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (<m>the third<\/m>, <m>May 5<\/m>), decade constructions (<m>the oughts<\/m>), year constructions (<m>1975<\/m>, <m>24 BCE<\/m>, <m>10 AH<\/m>, <m>year 19<\/m>, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs #Unit and #Whole are quite appropriate:\n<ex>The [4th|Unit] [of April|Whole] dawned clear and cold .<\/ex>\n<ex>[December|Whole] [11|Unit] was when Alix finally left .<\/ex>\n<ex>The [23rd|Unit] will be snowy . [DNI|Whole] <\/ex>\n<ex>Nothing much happened in the [90s|Unit] , did it ? [DNI|Whole] <\/ex>\nAs described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction:\n<ex>No-one has forgotten what happened the [5th|Unit] [of November|Whole] !<\/ex>\n<ex>No-one has forgotten [what happened|Trajector_event] [the 5th of November|Landmark_period] !<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\n\nWords in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. <ment>on Wednesday morning<\/ment>, cf. <ment>on Wednesday<\/ment>, but  <ment>in the morning<\/ment>) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. <ment>day after day<\/ment>),  N-by-N (e.g. <ment>week by week<\/ment>),  N-to-N (e.g. <ment>month to month<\/ment>), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. <ment>daily<\/ment>, <ment>weekly<\/ment>, <ment>monthly<\/ment>, etc.).\n\n\n",

        "description": "This frame presents a situation where there is a certain #Number of instances of an #Entity or a certain #Number that quantifies a #Unit. Numbers are used to count any kind of #Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count #Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the #Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual #Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the #Units. A countable #Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the #Entity, and each instance of the #Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of #Entity it is described as.   #Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a #Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the #Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with #Units rather than #Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole #Unitor #Entity (half.n), or the lack of a #Unit or #Entity (zero.num).\n<ex><\/ex>\nThere is also a #Precision associated with the #Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the #Number that is assumed, especially for so-called \"\"round\"\" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their #Precision, with phrases like \"\"about\"\", etc.\n\n<ex>Only [[two|Target]|Number] [senators|Entity] voted in support of the president .<\/ex>\n<ex>Dr. Malik has confined [almost|Precision] a [[score|Target]|Num] [of such unfortunates|Entity] in his basement, you know.<\/ex>\n<ex>We endured [[forty|Target]|Number] [days of snow|Entity] .<\/ex>\n<ex>There were [[thirty|Num]|Target] [of the little blue creatures|Entity] staring up at him.<\/ex>\n<ex>She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had [[ten|Target]|Number]!

Firstly, a #Number may itself be quantified by having a certain #Multiplier, e.g. \"\"three hundred\"\".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without \"\"and\"\", to produce a #Composite_number representing a #Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the #Entity or #Unit.\n\n<ex>Stephen has more than [five|mul] [[hundred|Number]|Target] in his closet! [DNI|Entity]<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\nAs can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a #Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a #Unit:\n\n<ex>There are just over [[six|Target]|Number] [billion|Unit] people in the world today.<\/ex>\n<ex>There are [just over|deg] [six|Multiplier] [[billion|Num]|Target] [people|Entity] in the world today.<\/ex>\n\nThe relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., \"\"3\"\" is a wordform of three.num).\n<ex><\/ex>\nOf more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (\"\"A whopping [three|Target] singers showed up\"\")\n\n<ex><\/ex>\n\nTechnical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between \"\"six apples\"\" and \"\"six of the apples\"\".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that \"\"six of the apples\"\" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of #Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like \"\"six of the apples\"\".\n\n\n",

In (4), it is not the <ment>number of times<\/ment> that turbot was caught that has changed but the <ment>amount<\/ment> of fish caught.\n\n<ex>(4) [Turbot catches|Item] [increased|Target] [from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s|val1] [to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s|val2].<\/ex>\n<ex>(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches [increased|Target] [from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s|att] [to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s|att].<\/ex>\n\n(Note the 2nd layer annotation of the #Attribute below the #Initial_value and #Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the #Attribute is implicitly <ment>weight<\/ment>.)\n\nSimilarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.\n\n<ex>(5)[Overall Giving by Church Members|Item] [increased|Target]  from 2000 to 2001<\/ex>\n\nAs can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify #Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"\"turbot catches\"\" as an #Attribute that includes information about the #Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:\n\n<ex>*Turbot [increased|Target] in catches.<\/ex>\n\nTwo more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an #Attribute.\n\n<ex>(6) The population of Smallville [increased|Target] fourfold to 807.<\/ex>\n\n\nUnder one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"\"the people\"\", in which case the #Attribute <ment>cardinality<\/ment> is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The #Attribute could be overtly specified:\n\n<ex>(6a) [The population of Smallville|ite] [increased|Target] [fourfold|Diff] [in size|att] [to 807|val2].<\/ex>\n\nUnder another reading, (6b), population is an #Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"\"the population of Smallville\"\" is treated as the #Attribute and on the second layer \"\"of Smallville\"\" is tagged as #Item.\n\n<ex>(6b) [The population of Smallville|att] [increased|Target] [fourfold|Diff] [to 807|val2].<\/ex>\n<ex>(6b-second FE layer) The population [of Smallville|ite] [increased|Target] fourfold to 807.<\/ex>\nSupport for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).\n\n<ex>(6c) [Smallville|ite] [increased|Target] [fourfold|Diff] [in population|att] [to 807|val2].<\/ex>\n\n\nThe last complication is that #Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of #Attribute.\n\n<ex>(7) [The 1999 price|val1] had [increased|Target] [to $3400|val2] [by 2001|Time].<\/ex>\n<ex>(7--second layer) The 1999 [price|att] had [increased|Target] to $3400 by 2001.<\/ex>\n\nThere is no #Attribute \"\"1999 price\"\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-#Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), #Attribute would only be indicated as \"\"price\"\" on the 2nd layer.\n",

Usually, the #Consequence and #Anti_consequence are also mutually exclusive, but in some cases (especially with \"\"even if\"\") the same #Consequence results regardless of whether one considers the #Profiled_possibility or the #Opposite_possibility. Neither of the possibilities is asserted and neither can simply be merged with a factual understanding of the world. Both possibilities are presented as uncertain, and the #Profiled_possibility may be further characterized with a neutral stance towards it, or with a doubtful, negative stance, depending on the specific lexical unit introducing the conditional and what verb forms are used in the #Profiled_possibility.\n<ex><\/ex>\n\n<ex>[If|Target] [you read caerfully|Profiled_possibility], [you 'll see the letters are swapped|Consequence].<\/ex>\n<ex>[Unless|Target] [you read carefully|Profiled_possibility] , [you wo n't understand what I said|Anti_consequence] .<\/ex>\n\nThe most common use of lexical units connected to the Conditional_scenario is for prediction; in this case the conditionals pair up possibilities with predicted consequences. Subtypes of this use include, but are not limited to:\n<ex><\/ex>\n(1) contingencies:\n<ex>[If|Target] [it rains|Profiled_possibility], [the ceremony will be under the tent|Consequence].<\/ex>\n\n(2) conditional promises (usually when making a deal):\n<ex>[If|Target] [you will wait with reasonable patience|Profiled_possibility] , [I will explain|Consequence]<\/ex>\n\n(3) threats (which are inherently conditional):\n<ex>[If|Target] [any boy says anything to Weeks about it|Profiled_possibility], [I will cane him.|Consequence]<\/ex>\n\n(4) hypotheticals, especially when a different choice was made in the past and one imagines it would lead to a different outcome:\n<ex>[If|Target] [I had elected to stay there|Profiled_possibility], [I probably would not have become homeless five years later|Consequence].<\/ex>\n\n(5) descriptions of general rules of the world:\n<ex>[You only get shingles|Consequence] [if|Target] [you have had chickenpox|Profiled_possibility].<\/ex>\n\n(6) descriptions of the characteristics of individual entities or persons that have an effect under certain circumstances:\n<ex>[If|Target] [Joey says you're in|Profiled_possibility], [you're in|Consequence].<\/ex>\n\n<ex><\/ex>\n<m>Speech act conditionals:<\/m>\n<ex><\/ex>\nLexical units of these frames can also be used in a pattern called a \"\"Speech Act conditional\"\".  In this case, the conditional presents a statement that is relevant to the conversation if the #Profiled_possibility holds.\n\n<ex>[Just ask for Bob|Consequence] [if|Target] [you need anything|Profiled_possibility].<\/ex>\n\nThe relevance of the statement is a #Consequence of the #Profiled_possibility, but there is no distinct alternative intended, so this usage does not normally allow distancing verb forms (see Dancygier and Sweetser 2005: 114-115). As shown in the above example, we annotate the potentially relevant statement as #Consequence.  This is based on an analysis of the filler of the #Consequence as metonymically expressing a message similar to \"\"it is relevant to say the following: ...\"\".  Such cases should be tagged with the clause-level tag \"\"Speech act\"\".  Thus in the following example, it is relevant for the speaker to explain the situation by saying \"\"no, she's not my wife\"\" if the other person is wondering about that possibility:\n\n<ex>[In case|Target] [you're wondering|Profiled_possibility], [no she's not my wife|Consequence].<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\n<m>Metalinguistic conditionals:<\/m>\n<ex><\/ex>\nIn addition, conditionals can be used to talk about the actual encoding of a message and usually encode a strong opinion about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a description, often in contrast to someone else's contrary opinion. Such sentences should be tagged \"\"Metalinguistic\"\", as in the following:\n\n<ex>[If|Target] [that's not success|Profiled_possibility], [I don't know what is|Consequence].<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\n<m>Epistemic conditionals:<\/m>\n<ex><\/ex>\nFinally, conditionals can be used to profile a reasoning process.  While all conditionals mark the connection from a hypothetical situation to an associated conclusion, many conditionals specifically highlight this process of thinking about the connection, especially when the reasoning is cooccurring with speaking, and most obviously when reasoning from effects to causes. In such cases as the following, we mark the clause as \"\"Epistemic\"\":\n\n<ex>[If|Target] [the lights are on|Profiled_possibility], [then somebody is home|Consequence].<\/ex>\n\nMany sentences are vague about exactly to what degree they profile the reasoning process, so sentences like the following can be legitimately labeled \"\"Epistemic\"\" or not:\n\n<ex>[If|Target] [you believe that what you are doing is right|Profiled_possibility] [then you can't compromise|Consequence].<\/ex>\n\n<ex><\/ex>\n<m>Special constructions:<\/m>\n<ex><\/ex>\nConditionals interact significantly with ellipsis constructions, particularly because they often occur in parallel structures in which different possibilities are being contrasted, or cases in which there is a contrast between what is always true and what is only conditionally true.  In these cases, the #Profiled_possibility and the #Consequence or #Anti_consequence may be abbreviated under the same conditions that apply to ellipsis in the rest of the language.  See the following examples:\n\n<ex>She would visit for at least a week and, [if|Target] [necessary|Profiled_possibility], [an additional day or two|Consequence].<\/ex>\n\nIn these examples, \"\"an additional day or two\"\" is understood as \"\"she would stay an additional day or two\"\", based on the immediately preceding sentence.  This is a general construction that allows a finite sentence that is parallel to an immediately adjacent clause to be abbreviated just to the content in addition to or contrasting with the adjacent clause. Since it must be interpreted as a full clause and occurs in exactly the places a clause is expected, we actually annotate the PT of the #Consequence as \"\"Sfin\"\" in these cases. The adjective \"\"necessary\"\" in the #Profiled_possibility, however, is not licensed by a general construction that allows an adjective like necessary to be used arbitrarily in the kinds of places a clause would be found. Therefore, in this case, we consider the adjective to represent a separate valence with PT \"\"AP\"\".",

        "description": "This frame covers the basic uses of direction words like the adverbs east, up, and forward.  These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that \"\"forward\"\" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n and direction.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available, and obligatorily occur with some other means of specifying the direction (\"\"that way\"\", \"\"the same way\"\", \"\"the direction she went\"\").\n\nThis frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the #Path from the #Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:\n\n<ex>We went [[north|Path]|Target] . [DNI|Landmark]<\/ex>\n\nIn such cases, a #Distance from the #Landmark can also be given:\n\n<ex>After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved [three feet|Distance] <m>to<\/m> the [left|Target] . [DNI|Landmark]<\/ex>\n\nIt can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the #Distance frame element:\n\n<ex>Look [[left|Path]|Target] and you 'll see it . [DNI|Landmark] <\/ex>\n\nAlthough rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the #Landmark:\n\n<ex>The book was unreachable, [10 feet|Distance] [[up|Path]|Target] on the shelf. [DNI|Landmark]<\/ex>\n<ex>[[East|Target]|Path] [of Mt. Diablo|Landmark] the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\n\nIn this fictive motion case, the #Domain and the #Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.\n\nNote this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:\n\n<ex>??? The book faced [above|Target] the door .<\/ex>\nvs.\n<ex>The book faced [upward|Target] .<\/ex>\n\nA potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by \"\"of\"\", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:\n\n<ex>??? I faced [east|Target] of the mountains .<\/ex>\n\nAnother potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word \"\"to\"\".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like \"\"to the east\"\", as well as \"\"to both sides\"\" and \"\"to the rear\"\".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.\n\nIn the following case, the #Domain is \"\"potency\"\" and the #Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.\n\n<ex><\/ex>\n<ex>They decided to rerate the medication [downward|Target] [in potency|Domain] .<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\n\nIn mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a #Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space #Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a #Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional #Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The #Domain and\/or the #Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the #Domain is space, and time is the #Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.",

Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number (\"\"a little whiskey\"\", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average (\"\"a mite stupid\"\", \"\"somewhat confused\"\" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category (\"\"something of a klutz\"\"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition (\"\"I, like, waved it around\"\").

Multiple identities can also exist when each is primarily associated with a fragment or aspect of the history and attributes of an entity, and the \"\"true\"\" identity might be very much debatable; in most such cases, there are different names associated with the different identities, as in the case of stage names or Ellis-Island names, but sometimes, the different \"\"identities\"\" go under the same name (e.g., some members of secret societies). While these may be considered different identities, they refer to the same person.\n<ex><\/ex>\nThis frame is intended to cover cases where an entity is mentioned, but the category it fits is what is actually meant:\n\n<ex>We need to determine the [[identity|Identity]|Target] [of the metal used in the picture frame|Instance] .<\/ex>\n\nIn this case, it is not individual identity of the physical hunk of metal that is intended to be in question, but rather the category that the hunk of metal fits into; i.e., the specific element or elemental composition of the metal is what is in question.  Such sentences should be understood as determining which #Instance of the supercategory is intended.\n\n<ex><\/ex>\nThis frame is not intended to cover related, and often more common, uses of the word \"\"identity\"\" such as \"\"sexual identity\"\", \"\"national identity\"\", or \"\"brand identity\"\", which do not refer to a unique identity of an #Instance, or even the identity of a supercategory of the #Instance, but rather refer to the specific properties of an #Instance that are considered very important for how the #Instance operates in aggregate.  Thus, uses like \"\"losing your identity\"\" are not intended to be covered by this frame.",

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level\/static uses (\"\"a STRONG person\"\") as well as stage-level\/dynamic uses (\"\"a STRONG push\"\").

Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).\n\n<ex><\/ex>\n\nTwo related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.\nThis frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force <m>exertion<\/m> instead of the level of <m>resistance<\/m>, and also in that there are three categories of core FE available to the target (i.e #Exerter, #Action, or #Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame's FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target.

        "description": "A  #Mitigating_situation is presented as occurring against the backdrop of a more preferable situation and a less preferable situation that, while expected, feared, or hoped for, did not or will not occur; the #Mitigating_situation is thus, so to speak, sandwiched between a better and a worse situation, both of which are relevant in the discourse. Understanding the #Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the #Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.\n\n<ex>[At least|Target] [I don’t have to go to school|MS].<\/ex>\n\n<ex>[|MS]<m>Ava<\/m>, [anyway|Target], [knew who he was|MS].<\/ex>\n\nWhen the [Mitigating_situation|MS] clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)\n<ex><\/ex>\nTargets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full <ex>#Mitigating_situation:<\/ex>\n\n<ex>There will be no exceptions -- [not for you|Mitigating_situation], [at any rate|Target].<\/ex>\nIn this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context.\n<ex><\/ex>\nLexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of <m>or<\/m> that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of <m>or<\/m> is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, <m>or<\/m> joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express:\n<ex>She traveled, and [now she is back here to transform|MS] our drab little lives, <m>or<\/m> [at any rate|Target], [our drab furniture|MS].<\/ex>\n<ex><\/ex>\nThe humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving <m>or<\/m>, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.\n<ex><\/ex>\nThis frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the #Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with <m>although<\/m>, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form):\n<ex>[Although|Target] <m>she’s not my favorite<\/m>, a new actress has won this time [in any case|Target].<\/ex>\n\nIn Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.\n\n<ex>[If|Target] it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.<\/ex>\n<ex>[Unless|Target] you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.<\/ex>\n\n",

Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the #Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological #Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.

        "description": "A #Figure is located essentially at the same location as a #Ground, which is viewed as point-like, or having no important internal or external structure.  Typically, the #Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the #Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a #Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why \"\"at the store\"\" is typically used even when a #Figure is inside the #Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case \"\"in the store\"\" would be more usual).\n\n<ex>[We|Figure] <m>are<\/m> [now|Time] [at|Target] [the cathedral|Ground] .<\/ex>\n<ex>They claim that [many Christians were martyred|Figure] [at|Target] [the Collosseum|Ground] .<\/ex>\n<ex>[I|Figure] <m>'m<\/m> [at|Target] [my mother 's|Ground] .<\/ex>\n\nThis frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.\n\n<ex> [Tesla stock|Figure] <m>is<\/m> [at|Target] [a three-month low|Ground] [today|Time] .<\/ex>\n<ex>[She put the biscuits in the oven|Figure] [at|Target] [only 400 degrees|Ground] .<\/ex>\n<ex>[At|Target] [fifty dollars|Ground] , [everyone 's gonna buy one|Figure] !<\/ex>\n<ex>If [you|Figure] <m>'re<\/m> only [at|Target] [page 20|Ground] , just start over .<\/ex>\n",

For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements).\n<ex><\/ex>\nIn addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically \"\"impinging\"\" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following:\n<ex>that led to Dolce and Gabbana to [base their autumn\/winter D and G collection|Figure] [around|Target] [her style|Ground] in 2008<\/ex>\n<ex>But he discovered that [the literary world|Ground] was a battlefield— mined with hatred, [rimmed|Target] [with snipers|Figure]. <\/ex>\n<ex>[Countless legends|Figure] sprung up [around|Target] [the knight|Ground].<\/ex>\n\nCommon abstract entities that serve as #Figure include emotions ('the hopelessness [surrounding|Target] them'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies ('Ageism [surrounds|Target] us, but passes largely unnoticed').\nThis metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the #Figure may physically impinge on the #Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.",
