## Project Overview

### Project Goal

To develop a cognitive framework based on simplified cortical columns that can represent and process knowledge using frame-based structures, integrating insights from neurocognitive linguistics and embodied cognition while maintaining computational tractability.

### Key Design Principles

- **Biological Inspiration**: Grounded in cortical column architecture but simplified for computational implementation
- **Frame-Based Representation**: Compatible with Minsky's "Society of Mind" frame/slot structures and FrameNet-style semantic frames
- **Embodied Cognition**: Uses manually implemented image schemas as foundational spatial-semantic structures
- **Language-Centric Interface**: Primary interaction through natural language using LLMs
- **Distributed Processing**: No central processor; intelligence emerges from network interactions

### Departure from UKS Approach

Initially considered leveraging Charles Simon's Universal Knowledge Store (UKS) from the Brain Simulator project, but decided against it due to architectural mismatch with frame-based requirements. The framework needed better compatibility with:

- Minsky's frame/slot notation from "Society of Mind"
- FrameNet Project-style semantic frame representation
- Image schema structures for spatial reasoning

---

## Theoretical Foundations

### Sidney Lamb's Neurocognitive Linguistics

The framework draws heavily from Sydney Lamb's Relational Network Theory (RNT) and neurocognitive linguistics:

#### Core Concepts Applied:

1. **Functional Webs**: Concepts represented as distributed networks across cortical areas
2. **Cortical Columns as Computational Units**: Minicolumns (30-50 microns, 70-110 neurons) serving as basic processing nodes
3. **Cardinal Nodes**: Hierarchical organization with top-level nodes coordinating entire functional webs
4. **Adjacency Principle**: Related functions occupy spatially adjacent cortical locations
5. **Integration and Broadcasting**: Basic cortical operations for information processing
6. **Bidirectional Connectivity**: Allows both bottom-up recognition and top-down inference
7. **Hebbian Learning**: Connection strengthening through repeated use

#### Lamb's Six Hypotheses:

1. **Functional Webs**: Concepts as distributed cortical networks
2. **Cortical Columns**: Nodes implemented as cortical columns
3. **Nodal Specificity**: Each node has specific function, with adjacency for related functions
4. **Extrapolation to Humans**: Findings from animal studies apply to human cognition
5. **Hierarchy**: Functional webs organized hierarchically
6. **Cardinal Nodes**: Each web has a top-level coordinating node

### Friedemann Pulvermüller's Contributions

While less central than Lamb's work, Pulvermüller's research provides additional support:

- **Action-Perception Circuits**: Distributed cell assemblies bridging perception and action
- **Cortical Topography**: Spatial arrangement reflects semantic relationships
- **Embodied Language**: Neural circuits for language grounded in sensorimotor systems

---

## Overall Architecture

The framework consists of four primary modules/components:

### (A) Conceptual/Cognitive Network

- **Structure**: Graph-based network where each node is a simplified cortical column
- **Storage**: Neo4j graph database for network representation and connectivity
- **Semantics**: Meaning emerges from distributed activation patterns across hundreds/thousands of nodes
- **No Isolated Meaning**: No single node contains complete meaning; concepts exist in network relationships

### (B) Language Interface Module

- **Primary Interface**: Natural language interaction using Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Input Processing**: LLM parsing of user inputs to generate network-compatible structures
- **Output Generation**: LLM conversion of network processing results to natural language responses
- **Bidirectional Translation**: Between natural language and internal frame-based representations

### (C) Processing Components (Agents)

- **Implementation**: Object-oriented programming language
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Following Minsky's "Society of Mind" principles
- **Individual Agent Characteristics**: Simple, specialized functions
- **Collective Intelligence**: Complex behaviors emerge from agent cooperation
- **Core Functions**: Spread activation, reasoning, inference, database interface, coordination

### (D) User Interface

- **Platform**: Web application
- **Interaction Model**: Natural language conversation
- **Accessibility**: Browser-based access to cognitive framework capabilities

## Core Components

### Simplified Cortical Column Structure

#### Three-Layer Abstraction:

1. **Layer 4 (Input Layer)**
    
    - **Function**: Receives and integrates signals from other cortical columns
    - **Implementation**: Connection endpoints from other network nodes
    - **Processing**: Threshold-based activation aggregation
2. **Layers 2/3 (Feature Processing Layer)**
    
    - **Function**: Aggregates input information into feature clusters/relations
    - **Structure**: Represents frame elements (roles/slots) and their properties
    - **Connectivity**: Lateral connections enabling inter-concept communication
    - **Processing**: Feature extraction and relationship identification
3. **Layer 5 (Output Layer)**
    
    - **Function**: Contains cardinal nodes representing complete concepts
    - **Structure**: One or more nodes serving as concept identifiers
    - **Connectivity**: Broadcasts activation to other columns' input layers
    - **Implementation**: Output interface for concept activation

#### Network Connectivity Types:

1. **Input Connections (Layer 4)**: From other concepts' output layers
2. **Lateral Connections (Layer 2/3)**: Between related concepts at feature level
3. **Output Connections (Layer 5)**: To other concepts' input layers

### Frame Structure Implementation

#### Conceptual Mapping:

- **Frame**: Complete cortical column (all three layers)
- **Frame Elements/Slots**: Feature clusters in Layer 2/3
- **Fillers**: Specific values/instances connected to frame elements

#### Supported Concept Types:

- **Percepts**: Sensory-grounded representations
- **Abstract Concepts**: Higher-level semantic structures
- **Words/Lemmas**: Linguistic units with phonological and semantic components
- **Semantic Frames**: Structured situation representations (FrameNet-style)
- **Image Schemas**: Spatial-semantic foundational structures

## Design Decisions and Rationale

### Hybrid Processing Model

**Decision**: Implement hybrid processing where:

- Basic operations (spread activation, thresholding, integration, broadcasting) remain intrinsic to cortical columns
- Complex operations (reasoning chains, constraint satisfaction) handled by agents
- Interface operations (LLM parsing/generation) implemented as pure agent functions

**Rationale**: Maintains biological plausibility for fundamental operations while providing computational flexibility for higher-level reasoning.

### Brain/Mind Distinction

**Decision**: Separate static network representation ("brain") from dynamic processing agents ("mind")

**Rationale**:

- **Network**: Provides stable representational substrate with biological inspiration
- **Agents**: Enable flexible, programmable cognitive operations
- **Clear Boundaries**: Facilitates debugging and system understanding

### Cardinal Node Adoption

**Decision**: Include cardinal nodes at Layer 5 despite added complexity

**Rationale**:

- **Integration Point**: Necessary for aggregating Layer 2/3 feature patterns
- **Broadcast Source**: Single point for transmitting concept activation
- **Addressability**: Unique identifier for each concept in the network
- **Computational Necessity**: Required for efficient concept manipulation

### Language-Primary Interface

**Decision**: Focus on linguistic rather than perceptual/robotic interfaces

**Rationale**:

- **Project Scope**: Avoids robotics complexity while maintaining cognitive depth
- **LLM Leverage**: Takes advantage of current LLM capabilities
- **Image Schema Foundation**: Manual implementation provides spatial grounding without perceptual complexity
