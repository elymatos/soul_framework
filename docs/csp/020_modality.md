# Chapter 20: Modality

- **33 axioms total** covering modes of existence including real existence, time, possibility, necessity, and qualitative probability
- **4 main sections**: Rexist and atTime, Positive Modalities, Possibility and Necessity, Likelihood (Qualitative Probability)
- **All background theory** - foundational modal framework for reasoning about different modes of existence

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Real Existence and Time Framework**:
    - Axiom Schema 20.1: Unprimed predicates equivalent to reified predicates with Rexist
    - Axiom Schema 20.2: Temporal arguments equivalent to atTime relations
    - Axioms 20.4-20.6: Now as unique temporal anchor connecting Rexist to atTime
    - Foundation for relating atemporal logic to temporal reality

2. **Positive Modalities**:
    - Axiom 20.7: PosMod as cover term for modalities supporting inference
    - Axiom 20.8: Rexist as exemplar positive modality
    - Axiom 20.9: Modus ponens preservation within positive modalities
    - Framework enabling systematic treatment of inference-supporting modes

3. **Constraint-Relative Possibility and Necessity**:
    - Axioms 20.10-20.11: Possibility as absence of constraint-implied negation
    - Axioms 20.13-20.14: Necessity as constraint-implied conclusion
    - Axioms 20.12,20.15: Both as positive modalities
    - Axioms 20.16-20.17: Duality relationships and impossibility definition

4. **Qualitative Likelihood Theory**:
    - Axiom 20.18-20.19: Likelihood scales with partial ordering (not total numerical)
    - Axioms 20.20-20.21: AlsoRequired framework linking likelihood to minimal assumptions
    - Axioms 20.22-20.26: Conjunction/disjunction operations and scale extremes
    - Axioms 20.27-20.33: Likelihood as scale-based concept with Hi region definition

5. **Scale Integration**:
    - Likelihood scales as partially ordered (not total like probability)
    - Integration with Chapter 12's scale framework (Hi regions, vertical scales)
    - Grounds for likelihood scales enabling "at" relations
    - Comparative likelihood through scale ordering

## Technical Sophistication:
- **Axiom Schemas**: Two schemas relating different predicate styles and temporal representations
- **Modal Logic Foundation**: Systematic treatment of alethic modalities with constraint relativity
- **Qualitative Probability**: Non-numerical alternative to mathematical probability theory
- **Scale-Based Modality**: Likelihood defined through scale positions rather than numbers
- **Positive Modality Theory**: Unified framework for inference-preserving modalities

## Complexity Distribution:
- Simple: 20 axioms (basic constraints, type requirements, simple definitions)
- Moderate: 9 axioms (modal definitions, scale operations)
- Complex: 4 axioms (axiom schemas, likelihood scale definition, constraint-based definitions)

## Conceptual Importance:
This chapter provides crucial infrastructure for:
- **Belief and Knowledge**: Modal framework for epistemic states and uncertainty
- **Planning and Decision**: Possibility and likelihood for action selection
- **Natural Language**: Modal expressions ("possible", "likely", "necessary")
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Connecting atemporal logic to time-indexed reality
- **Uncertainty Reasoning**: Qualitative probability for everyday inference

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 5 (Eventualities)**: Fundamental eventuality framework and Rexist predicate
- **Chapter 8 (Logic Reified)**: Uses imply, not', and', or' for modal operations
- **Chapter 12 (Scales)**: Likelihood scales, Hi regions, ordering relationships
- **Chapter 16 (Time)**: atTime predicate and temporal anchoring
- **Future Psychology Chapters**: Modal framework for belief, planning, goal reasoning

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Game Rules**: Tic-tac-toe possibility relative to game vs. physics constraints
- **Chess Necessity**: Required moves relative to chess rules vs. physical laws
- **Weather Prediction**: "Likely to rain" without precise probability
- **Everyday Uncertainty**: Qualitative likelihood judgments without mathematical basis
- **Temporal Examples**: Past likelihood (Booth acted alone), future likelihood (election outcomes)

## Notable Design Decisions:
- **Constraint Relativity**: Possibility and necessity always relative to constraint sets
- **Qualitative Probability**: Partial ordering instead of numerical probabilities
- **Positive Modality Framework**: Unified treatment of inference-supporting modalities
- **Now as Anchor**: Connecting atemporal Rexist to temporal atTime
- **Non-Numerical Likelihood**: Avoiding precision that humans don't actually have
- **Scale-Based Hi Region**: "Likely" as high position on likelihood scale

## Theoretical Significance:
Chapter 20 represents a sophisticated philosophical and logical foundation for reasoning about different modes of existence and uncertainty. The constraint-relative treatment of possibility and necessity provides a flexible framework that can accommodate different contexts (game rules, physical laws, social conventions) while maintaining logical rigor.

The qualitative approach to probability reflects how humans actually reason about uncertainty - with partially ordered judgments rather than precise numerical probabilities. The integration with scale theory enables contextual interpretation of likelihood claims while avoiding the false precision of numerical approaches.

The positive modality framework provides a unified foundation for different types of inference-supporting modalities, crucial for the cognitive theories that follow. The axiom schemas connecting different representational styles (unprimed/primed predicates, temporal arguments/atTime) enable flexible reasoning across different logical contexts.

This modal framework is essential for the psychological theories in Part III, providing the logical foundation for beliefs (which may not correspond to reality), goals (which represent desired possibilities), and plans (which reason about likelihood and necessity of outcomes). The chapter thus bridges pure logic and cognitive psychology by providing the modal concepts necessary for representing mental states and uncertain reasoning.
