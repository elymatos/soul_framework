# Chapter 6: Tradicional set theory
- **22 axioms total** covering traditional set theory operations
- **Single section** but comprehensive coverage of set theory fundamentals
- **All background theory** - foundational mathematical concepts

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Set Theory Foundation**: Standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without Axiom of Infinity
2. **Equality Properties**: Axioms 6.3-6.5 establish reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of equality
3. **Set Operations**: Complete coverage of:
    - Basic operations: union, intersection, difference
    - Construction: addElt, deleteElt, replaceElt
    - Special sets: null, singleton, doubleton, power set
    - Relations: subset, proper subset, disjoint

4. **Pattern Types**:
    - Set construction and manipulation (6.8, 6.11, 6.12)
    - Standard set operations (6.13, 6.15, 6.16)
    - Recursive definitions (6.21 for cardinality)
    - Type constraints and definitions

5. **Complexity Distribution**:
    - Simple: 6 axioms (basic properties, simple definitions)
    - Moderate: 8 axioms (medium complexity definitions)
    - Complex: 8 axioms (multi-quantifier definitions like equality, union, intersection)

6. **Notable Features**:
    - Axiom 6.1 (set equality) is particularly complex with nested quantifiers
    - Axiom 6.21 (cardinality) uses recursive definition
    - Axiom 6.22 introduces typed sets (sets of eventualities)
