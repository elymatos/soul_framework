# Chapter 34: Causes of Failure

- **6 axioms total** covering plan failure explanation patterns and three-way failure classification based on causal complexes
- **1 main section**: Causes of Failure (34.4) with comprehensive failure taxonomy
- **Pure psychology** - systematic framework for explaining why plans fail, integrating 15+ years of AI research on explanation patterns

## Key Features Identified:

### 1. **Foundational Failure Framework** (Axioms 34.1-34.2):

#### **Core Definitions**:
- **Axiom 34.1**: `tryBy` - **complex trying framework**
  - Agent believes action is in causal complex for goal achievement
  - Goal causes action execution (motivational causation)
  - Integrates belief, causation, and goal-directed action
  - Foundation for all failure analysis
- **Axiom 34.2**: `failBy` - **simple failure definition**
  - Trying without goal achievement
  - Failure as outcome of trying, not absence of trying
  - Links failure directly to unsuccessful goal pursuit

#### **Causal Complex Integration**:
- **Causal Complex Theory**: From Chapter 15, sets of conditions jointly causing outcomes
- **Belief-Action Link**: Agents act because they believe actions will achieve goals
- **Motivational Causation**: Goals cause actions through agent reasoning

### 2. **Three-Way Failure Classification** (Axioms 34.3-34.6):

#### **Type 1 Failure: Flawed Theory** (Axiom 34.3):
- **Definition**: Causal complex doesn't actually cause goal achievement
- **Problem**: Agent's beliefs about causation are incorrect
- **Examples**: Wrong medicine for illness, ineffective study methods
- **Nature**: Theoretical/epistemic failure

#### **Type 2 Failure: Missing Conditions** (Axiom 34.4):
- **Definition**: Some conditions in causal complex don't hold
- **Problem**: Necessary conditions absent despite correct theory
- **Examples**: Recipe missing ingredients, plan missing resources
- **Nature**: Environmental/circumstantial failure

#### **Type 2a Failure: Hail Mary Attempts** (Axiom 34.5):
- **Special Subcase**: Agent hopes but doesn't believe conditions hold
- **Definition**: Type 2 failure where agent knows success is unlikely
- **Example**: "Hail Mary" football pass with low success probability
- **Nature**: Desperate attempt with acknowledged low likelihood

#### **Type 3 Failure: Recursive/Execution Failure** (Axiom 34.6):
- **Definition**: Failure to achieve subgoal causes failure of main goal
- **Problem**: Execution breakdown in plan hierarchy
- **Recursive Structure**: Subgoal failure can be Type 1, 2, or 3
- **Examples**: Can't open jar → can't make sandwich → can't eat lunch
- **Nature**: Hierarchical/execution failure

### 3. **Comprehensive Failure Taxonomy**:

#### **15 Major Categories** (Natural Language):
1. **Flawed Theory** (Type 1)
2. **Missing Condition** (Type 2) 
3. **Hail Mary** (Type 2a)
4. **Execution Failure** (Type 3)
5. **Conflicting Goals**
6. **Resource Constraints**
7. **External Interference**
8. **Skill Deficits**
9. **Knowledge Gaps**
10. **Temporal Constraints**
11. **Social/Interpersonal Blocks**
12. **Motivational Failure**
13. **Physical Limitations**
14. **Technology Failure**
15. **Environmental Changes**

#### **47+ Subcategories**:
- Each major category broken into specific failure patterns
- Cross-referenced with AI research from Yale/Northwestern schools
- Systematic coverage of human plan failure experiences

## Technical Sophistication:
- **Causal Complex Foundation**: Grounded in formal causation theory from Chapter 15
- **Recursive Definition**: Type 3 failures enable unlimited hierarchical depth
- **Belief Integration**: Connects failure analysis with belief systems from Chapter 21
- **Motivational Causation**: Goals cause actions through agent reasoning mechanisms
- **Reified Predicates**: 3 reified predicates for belief states and failure events
- **AI Research Synthesis**: 15+ years of explanation pattern research integration

## Complexity Distribution:
- **Simple**: 4 axioms (basic failure types, straightforward definitions)
- **Moderate**: 2 axioms (trying framework, recursive failure structure)
- **Complex**: 0 axioms (natural language taxonomy provides complexity)

## Conceptual Importance:
This chapter provides crucial infrastructure for:
- **Plan Debugging**: Systematic diagnosis of why plans fail
- **Learning from Failure**: Understanding failure patterns for future planning improvement
- **Explanation Generation**: Creating coherent stories about plan failures for communication
- **Case-Based Reasoning**: Indexing failure experiences for analogical reasoning
- **Risk Assessment**: Anticipating potential failure modes during planning
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Understanding others' plan failures for cooperation

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 15 (Causality)**: Causal complex theory as foundation for failure analysis
- **Chapter 21 (Belief)**: Agent beliefs about causal relationships underlying trying
- **Chapter 28 (Goals)**: Goal theory providing motivational structure for failure
- **Chapter 31 (Plans)**: Plan structure enabling hierarchical failure patterns
- **Chapter 32 (Goal Management)**: Goal abandonment as response to repeated failure
- **Chapter 33 (Execution Envisionment)**: Mental simulation for failure prediction

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Case Indexing**: Organizing failure experiences for retrieval and learning
- **Explanation Generation**: Creating coherent narratives about why plans failed
- **Explanation Recognition**: Understanding others' failure explanations
- **Yale AI Research**: Plan failure patterns from story understanding systems
- **Northwestern AI Research**: Goal failure analysis from planning systems
- **Hail Mary Examples**: Low-probability attempts in sports, business, relationships

## Notable Design Decisions:
- **Three-Way Classification**: Comprehensive coverage with manageable number of basic types
- **Recursive Structure**: Hierarchical failures handled through Type 3 recursion
- **Belief-Centric Framework**: Failure analysis grounded in agent belief systems
- **Causal Complex Integration**: Formal causation theory underlying all failure types
- **AI Research Synthesis**: 15 years of explanation pattern research systematically organized
- **Non-Defeasible Definitions**: All failure type definitions are strict logical classifications

## Theoretical Significance:
Chapter 34 addresses the fundamental challenge of explaining plan failures in a systematic, comprehensive manner. The three-way classification provides a principled decomposition of failure causes while the recursive structure enables unlimited hierarchical complexity.

The integration with causal complex theory provides formal foundations for failure analysis, moving beyond ad hoc categorizations toward principled diagnostic frameworks. The belief-centric approach acknowledges that failure analysis depends on agents' understanding of causation, not just objective facts.

The comprehensive taxonomy synthesizes decades of AI research on explanation patterns, providing systematic coverage of human failure experiences. This enables case-based reasoning, learning from failure, and improved planning through failure mode anticipation.

The framework supports three crucial applications: case indexing for analogical reasoning, explanation generation for communication, and explanation recognition for understanding others' accounts of failure.

The chapter's 6 axioms establish failure analysis as a systematic cognitive process, providing both theoretical precision and practical utility for modeling human reasoning about plan failures and learning from unsuccessful attempts.

This represents one of the most comprehensive formal treatments of plan failure in cognitive science, bridging AI research on explanation patterns with psychological theories of causal reasoning and goal-directed behavior.
