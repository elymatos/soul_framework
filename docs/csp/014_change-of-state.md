# Chapter 14: Change of state
- **13 axioms total** covering change of state and derived concepts
- **2 main sections**: The change Predicate and Predicates Derived from change
- **All background theory** - foundational concepts for temporal and causal reasoning

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Basic Change Framework**:
    - Axiom 14.1: Change arguments must be eventualities
    - Axiom 14.2: Changes must involve a common entity (prevents unrelated state changes)
    - Axiom 14.3: Change is defeasibly transitive (with etc conditions)

2. **Inconsistency and Cyclical Change**:
    - Axiom 14.4: Complex axiom handling inconsistency - if states aren't inconsistent, change must go through an inconsistent intermediate state
    - Axiom 14.5: Defeasible inference that start and end states are inconsistent (since change isn't normally cyclic)

3. **Derived Change Predicates**:
    - Axiom 14.6: changeIn - change in properties of an entity
    - Axiom 14.7: changeFrom - change out of a state (ensures no same-type state exists after)
    - Axiom 14.8: changeTo - change into a state (ensures no same-type state existed before)

4. **Movement and Vertical Scales**:
    - Axiom 14.9: move - change from being at one location to another
    - Axioms 14.10-14.11: Vertical scales (numeric scales are vertical; vertical arguments must be scales)
    - Axioms 14.12-14.13: increase/decrease as movement up/down vertical scales

5. **Technical Sophistication**:
    - **Reified Predicates**: Heavy use of primed predicates (change', at', etc.)
    - **Substitution**: Uses substitution framework from Chapter 7 for type/token distinctions
    - **Generation**: Uses gen relation for eventuality relationships
    - **Inconsistency**: Sophisticated handling of when states conflict

6. **Complexity Distribution**:
    - Simple: 6 axioms (basic constraints, type requirements)
    - Moderate: 6 axioms (derived predicate definitions)
    - Complex: 1 axiom (14.4 - change inconsistency requirement)

## Conceptual Importance:
This chapter provides crucial infrastructure for:
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Foundation for understanding processes and events over time
- **Causal Reasoning**: Change is prerequisite for causality
- **Natural Language**: Verbs of motion and change ("move," "increase," "become")
- **Psychological Processes**: Learning, growth, adaptation all involve change
- **Physical Processes**: Motion, transformation, development

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 7 (Substitution)**: Uses subst for type/token relationships
- **Chapter 8 (Logic Reified)**: Uses inconsistent and gen predicates
- **Chapter 10 (Composite Entities)**: Uses at relation for location
- **Chapter 12 (Scales)**: Uses lts and vertical scale concepts
- **Chapter 5 (Eventualities)**: Fundamental eventuality framework

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Physical**: Moving, growing, opening/closing doors
- **Cognitive**: Learning (not knowing → knowing)
- **Social**: Changing relationships, roles
- **Measurement**: Changes in quantities on scales
- **Spatial**: Movement from place to place

## Technical Sophistication:
- **Reified Change Framework**: Change as fundamental predicate relating eventualities with sophisticated argument constraints
- **Inconsistency Management**: Complex logic for handling when states conflict and intermediate inconsistent states
- **Derived Predicate System**: Systematic family of change predicates (changeIn, changeFrom, changeTo) with precise semantics
- **Vertical Scale Integration**: Movement up/down scales for increase/decrease with mathematical precision
- **Defeasible Transitivity**: Change propagation with etc conditions for realistic reasoning

## Complexity Distribution:
- Simple: 6 axioms (basic constraints, type requirements, simple definitions)
- Moderate: 6 axioms (derived predicate definitions with multiple conditions)
- Complex: 1 axiom (inconsistency requirement 14.4 with sophisticated logical structure)

## Conceptual Importance:
This chapter provides the **fundamental temporal infrastructure** for reasoning about processes, events, and transformations in commonsense domains. Change is the foundation for causality, learning, development, and all dynamic processes essential to psychological and physical reasoning. The framework enables systematic reasoning about state transitions while handling the complexities of inconsistency and temporal relationships. This infrastructure is crucial for representing the dynamic nature of mental states and processes.

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 5 (Eventualities)**: Fundamental eventuality framework underlying all change relationships
- **Chapter 7 (Substitution)**: Type/token distinctions crucial for change reasoning
- **Chapter 8 (Logic Reified)**: Inconsistency predicates and generation relationships
- **Chapter 10 (Composite Entities)**: At relation for location-based change
- **Chapter 12 (Scales)**: Vertical scales enabling increase/decrease reasoning
- **Chapter 15 (Causality)**: Change as prerequisite for causal relationships
- **Chapter 16 (Time)**: Temporal framework for sequencing changes
- **Psychology Chapters**: Learning, emotion, and cognitive changes throughout theories

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Physical Processes**: movement, growth, opening/closing, transformation
- **Cognitive Development**: learning transitions (not knowing → knowing)
- **Social Dynamics**: relationship changes, role transitions
- **Measurement Changes**: quantitative increases/decreases on scales
- **Spatial Movement**: location changes and navigation
- **Psychological Processes**: belief revision, emotion changes, goal shifts

## Notable Design Decisions:
- **Fundamental Treatment**: Change as undefined predicate too basic for formal definition
- **Eventuality Foundation**: Changes relate eventualities rather than simple entities
- **Defeasible Framework**: Exception handling through etc predicates for realistic reasoning
- **Vertical Metaphor**: Systematic "up/down" treatment for numeric and abstract scales
- **Inconsistency Requirement**: Sophisticated handling of when states conflict during transitions

## Theoretical Significance:
Chapter 14 establishes the **essential dynamic foundation** for commonsense reasoning about processes and transformations. Change is fundamental to causality, learning, and all temporal reasoning essential for psychological intelligence. The framework provides systematic method for reasoning about state transitions while handling the logical complexities of inconsistency and temporal relationships. This infrastructure enables the sophisticated reasoning about mental processes, learning, and development central to commonsense psychology.

## Unique Contributions:

### **Reified Change Framework**:
Systematic treatment of change as fundamental predicate relating eventualities, enabling meta-reasoning about transformations.

### **Inconsistency Management System**:
Sophisticated logic for handling conflicting states and intermediate inconsistent conditions during transitions.

### **Derived Change Taxonomy**:
Comprehensive family of change predicates (changeIn, changeFrom, changeTo) with precise logical semantics.

### **Vertical Scale Integration**:
Innovative connection between abstract change concepts and concrete scale-based increase/decrease reasoning.

### **Defeasible Transition Logic**:
Realistic framework for change reasoning that accommodates exceptions and context-dependent transitions.

This chapter provides the **fundamental dynamic infrastructure** essential for reasoning about the temporal processes, transformations, and developments that characterize both physical systems and psychological states throughout sophisticated commonsense reasoning.
