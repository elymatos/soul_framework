# Chapter 5: Eventualities and their structure
- **19 axioms total** covering eventualities and their structure
- **3 main sections**: Eventualities and Individuation, Structure of Eventualities, and Generation
- **All background theory** - this is a foundational chapter

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Axiom Schemas**: Several axioms (5.1, 5.3-5.6, 5.11, 5.13) are schemas that need instantiation for each predicate
2. **Reified Predicates**: Heavy use of primed predicates (give', run', go') representing reified eventualities
3. **Core Concepts**:
    - `eventuality` - fundamental concept
    - `argn` - argument structure
    - `gen` - generation relation between eventualities
    - `Rexist` - real existence in the world

4. **Pattern Types**:
    - Argument structure definitions (5.3-5.6)
    - Type constraints (5.7, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16)
    - Recursive definitions (5.10 for arg*)
    - Generation relations (5.2, 5.17-5.21)

5. **Complexity Distribution**:
    - Simple: 13 axioms (basic type constraints, simple implications)
    - Moderate: 4 axioms (existential definitions, temporal/spatial preservation)
    - Complex: 2 axioms (recursive definition of arg*, complete eventuality structure)
