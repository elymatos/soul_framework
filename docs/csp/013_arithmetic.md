# Chapter 13: Arithmetic
- **43 axioms total** covering Peano arithmetic, rational numbers, measures, and half-orders of magnitude
- **4 main sections**: Integers, Rational Numbers, Measures and Proportions, and Half-Orders of Magnitude
- **All background theory** - mathematical foundations

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Peano Arithmetic Foundation**:
    - Axioms 13.1-13.4: Base case (0), successor existence, constraints, and constants 0-10
    - Axioms 13.5-13.7: Positive integers, zero has no predecessor, successor uniqueness
    - Axioms 13.8-13.12: Addition (base case, recursive step, closure, associativity, commutativity)
    - Axioms 13.13-13.19: Multiplication (base case, recursive step, identity, properties, distributive law)
    - Axioms 13.20-13.24: Ordering relations (lt, leq, gt, geq) and number type

2. **Rational Numbers**:
    - Axiom 13.25: Fraction existence for nonnegative numerator and positive denominator
    - Axiom 13.26: Fraction equality using cross-multiplication
    - Axiom 13.27: Integer embedding (n = n/1)
    - Axioms 13.28-13.29: Extension of ordering and multiplication to fractions
    - Axioms 13.30-13.31: Type constraints for fractions

3. **Numeric Scales and Measures**:
    - Axioms 13.32-13.33: Nonnegative numeric scales with lt ordering
    - Axiom 13.34: Measures as monotone-increasing functions mapping bottom to zero
    - Axiom 13.35: Cardinality as measure on set-subset scales
    - Axioms 13.36-13.37: Proportions as ratios f = m(x)/m(y)
    - Axioms 13.38-13.40: Identity functions and measure-at relations

4. **Half-Orders of Magnitude**:
    - Axioms 13.41-13.43: Qualitative reasoning framework where entities are "same HOM" if their proportion squared ≤ 10
    - Captures commonsense approximate reasoning ("about", "approximately", "several")

5. **Notable Design Decisions**:
    - **Predicate-based**: Uses sum(n1,n2,n3) instead of n1+n2=n3 for consistency
    - **Constants**: Only constants in the entire book are integers 0-10
    - **Practical note**: Real systems would use procedural attachment, not theorem proving
    - **Extension ready**: Designed to extend to other number types if needed

6. **Complexity Distribution**:
    - Simple: 24 axioms (basic definitions, properties)
    - Moderate: 19 axioms (recursive definitions, multi-condition axioms)
    - Complex: 0 axioms (well-structured mathematical content)
