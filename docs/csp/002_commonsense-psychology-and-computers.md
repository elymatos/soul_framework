# Chapter 2: Commonsense Psychology and Computers

## Overview
- **Anthropomorphism as human universal** - examining how people naturally attribute human psychology to non-human entities
- **Human-computer interaction challenges** - analyzing gaps between user expectations and computational behavior
- **Desktop metaphor critique** - arguing that current interfaces discourage natural anthropomorphic tendencies
- **Anthropomorphic computing proposal** - advocating for systems that accommodate user anthropomorphism through commonsense psychology models

## Key Features Identified:

### 1. **Universal Anthropomorphism Framework**:
- **Evolutionary Utility**: Anthropomorphism as adaptive strategy for managing complexity in environment
- **Development Continuum**: From childhood toy attribution to adult institutional personification (governments, corporations)
- **Legal Recognition**: US Supreme Court cases establishing corporate personhood and free speech rights
- **Dennett's Intentional Stance**: Strategic attribution of beliefs, desires, and rational agency for behavioral prediction

### 2. **Human-Computer Discord Sources**:
- **Attention Focus Mismatch**: Users expect single-task focus while computers efficiently multthread dozens of processes
- **User Model Poverty**: Computers lack understanding of user mental states, goals, and contextual needs
- **Psychological Language Gaps**: Limited natural language understanding of mental state concepts despite their centrality to human communication
- **Counterintuitive Operations**: System behavior violates commonsense psychological expectations about intelligent behavior

### 3. **Desktop Metaphor Analysis**:
- **Historical Context**: Developed at Xerox PARC (1970s), popularized by Apple and Microsoft (1980s) for office worker market
- **Anthropomorphism Barrier**: Office objects are lifeless and familiar, reducing tendency to see computers as people
- **Turing Test Connection**: Early computing vision (Star Trek, HAL 9000) assumed anthropomorphic interaction
- **Future Obsolescence**: Ubiquitous computing will require more natural interaction metaphors than office environments

### 4. **Anthropomorphic Computing Vision**:
- **Postage-Stamp Computers**: Future scenario with ubiquitous, cheap computing requiring natural interaction
- **Natural User Instruction**: "You're a toaster" - direct anthropomorphic assignment of roles and capabilities
- **Commonsense Psychology Alignment**: Systems must operate according to how people think intelligent devices should behave
- **Facilitated Anthropomorphism**: Rather than discouraging, systems should support and leverage user anthropomorphic tendencies

### 5. **Computational Modeling Distinctions**:
- **Cognitive Models vs. Inferential Theories**: Models simulate reasoning processes vs. theories describe knowledge content
- **Knowledge Engineering Requirements**: Large-scale effort needed, not simple algorithmic solutions
- **Content Theory Approach**: Focus on axiom lists defining commonsense consequences rather than syntactic complexity
- **AI Engineering Methodology**: Systematic formalization approach for computational implementation

## Technical Sophistication:

### **Interdisciplinary Integration**:
- **Psychology**: Dennett's intentional stance, Reeves & Nass media equation research
- **Computer Science**: Human-computer interaction, knowledge representation, AI reasoning systems
- **Philosophy**: Eliminative materialism connections, theory of mind debates
- **Legal Studies**: Corporate personhood cases and institutional anthropomorphism

### **Human-Computer Interaction Analysis**:
- **Media Equation Research**: Experimental evidence that people treat computers as social agents
- **Politeness Effects**: Users inflate performance judgments when computers directly ask for feedback
- **Social Role Attribution**: Automatic application of human social behaviors to computational systems
- **Design Implications**: Alignment of user social/cognitive expectations with system behavior

### **Engineering Challenges**:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding psychological vocabulary and mental state references
- **User Modeling**: Tracking beliefs, goals, plans, preferences, attention states throughout interactions
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Dynamic computation of implications based on changing user mental models
- **Explanation Generation**: Producing comprehensible statements about system states and processes

## Complexity Distribution:
- **Anthropomorphism Theory**: 25% covering universality, development, and strategic utility
- **Human-Computer Discord**: 30% analyzing specific interaction problems and their psychological foundations

- **Implementation Framework**: 20% outlining computational requirements and engineering approaches

## Conceptual Importance:

### **Technological Transformation**:
Demonstrates how computing is transitioning from office-based tools to ubiquitous environmental presence, requiring fundamental changes in interaction paradigms. Shows that anthropomorphism is inevitable rather than optional in human-technology relationships.

### **Psychological Realism**:
Argues that effective human-computer interaction must accommodate rather than fight natural human psychological tendencies. Provides evidence that people automatically apply social and intentional reasoning to computational systems regardless of design intentions.

### **Engineering Requirements**:
Establishes that anthropomorphic computing requires explicit computational models of commonsense psychology rather than simple interface improvements. Demonstrates need for large-scale knowledge engineering efforts in psychological domain.

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 1**: Builds on commonsense psychology foundation by showing its necessity for technological interaction
- **Chapters 3-4**: Motivates need for formal logical approaches to representing psychological knowledge
- **Parts II-III**: Provides practical justification for detailed formalization work in subsequent chapters

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Word Processing**: Analysis of current applications' psychological blindness to user mental states
- **Future Ubiquitous Computing**: Postage-stamp computers requiring natural anthropomorphic interaction
- **Gaming and Multimedia**: Examples where anthropomorphic expectations create user frustration
- **Corporate and Government Systems**: Large-scale anthropomorphization in organizational contexts
- **Voice Assistants and Smart Devices**: Implied applications for current anthropomorphic computing

## Notable Design Decisions:

### **Anti-Desktop Argument**: 
Provides sustained critique of dominant interface paradigm, arguing it artificially suppresses natural anthropomorphic tendencies that should be embraced rather than discouraged.

### **Future Computing Vision**: 
Uses concrete scenarios (postage-stamp computers) to illustrate how ubiquitous computing will require anthropomorphic interaction methods, grounding abstract arguments in tangible examples.

### **Dennett Integration**: 
Adopts intentional stance as theoretical framework for understanding anthropomorphism, providing cognitive science foundation for engineering recommendations.

### **Discord Analysis**: 
Systematic examination of specific ways current systems violate psychological expectations, providing concrete requirements for anthropomorphic system design.

### **Engineering Realism**: 
Acknowledges that anthropomorphic computing requires substantial engineering effort rather than simple algorithmic solutions, setting realistic expectations for implementation challenges.

## Theoretical Significance:

Chapter 2 establishes anthropomorphic computing as both inevitable and beneficial for human-technology interaction. The chapter's strength lies in showing how anthropomorphism emerges from fundamental human cognitive architecture rather than from naive beliefs about technology.

The systematic analysis of human-computer discord demonstrates that current interaction problems stem from mismatches between human psychological expectations and system behavior. This analysis provides specific requirements for anthropomorphic system design: attention modeling, user mental state tracking, and psychologically-grounded natural language processing.

The historical analysis of the desktop metaphor shows how interface design can artificially suppress natural human tendencies. The argument that ubiquitous computing will make anthropomorphic interaction necessary provides strong motivation for developing the required computational models.

The chapter's treatment of computational modeling distinguishes between cognitive process simulation and knowledge content representation, clarifying the specific type of psychological modeling needed for anthropomorphic computing. This distinction is crucial for understanding the book's subsequent formal approach.

## Unique Contributions:

### **Anthropomorphic Computing Framework**:
First systematic argument for designing computational systems to facilitate rather than discourage user anthropomorphism, providing specific requirements for implementation.

### **Desktop Metaphor Critique**:
Historical analysis showing how current interface paradigms artificially suppress natural human psychological tendencies, arguing for fundamental design philosophy changes.

### **Future Computing Vision**:
