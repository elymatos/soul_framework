# Chapter 3: Formalizing Commonsense Psychology

## Key Features Identified:

### 1. **Successive Formalization Methodology**:
- **Four-Stage Process**: Strategy representation → linguistic analysis → draft formalizations → final theories
- **Coverage First**: Identifies full breadth before achieving depth/competency
- **Incremental Formalization**: Gradual progression from informal concepts to rigorous logical axioms
- **Contrasts with Traditional Approach**: Avoids early coverage abandonment for competency

### 2. **Strategy Representation Analysis**:
- **372 Strategies Collected**: Across 10 planning domains (business, education, warfare, etc.)
- **Analogical Foundation**: Strategies as shared relational structure between analogous planning cases
- **Conceptual Evidence**: Analogies reveal mental representation structures people use
- **Systematic Analysis**: From thousands of words/phrases to 988 unique concepts to 48 representational areas

### 3. **English Language Analysis**:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Thousands of words/phrases referring to mental states and processes
- **Three-Step Process**: Large-scale brainstorming → linguistic resource expansion → synonymous clustering
- **Finite-State Transducers**: 9,556 states and 85,153 transitions for automatic text annotation
- **PsychoPhrase Game**: Novel methodology for eliciting psychological language references

### 4. **Draft Formalizations**:
- **892 Axioms**: Across 30 content theories in first-order logic
- **Productivity Focus**: Liberal use of undefined predicates, relaxed axiomization style
- **Predicate Proliferation**: Multiple forms for single concepts (e.g., 9 forms for "instantiation")
- **Foundation Building**: Created representational basis for commonsense psychology

### 5. **Final Theories Development**:
- **Consistency Achievement**: Rigorous semantics and consistent predicate-argument relationships
- **Background Theories**: 16 theories for non-psychological concepts
- **Psychology Theories**: 29 commonsense psychology theories
- **ISO/IEC 24707 Standard**: Common Logic Interchange Format adoption

## Technical Sophistication:
- **Methodological Innovation**: First comprehensive approach to achieve both coverage and competency
- **Scale Achievement**: From informal concepts to formal logical theories across entire domain
- **Linguistic Engineering**: Advanced finite-state transducer technology for concept recognition
- **Logical Formalization**: Systematic progression from informal to formal representations
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 81.5% recall, 95.2% precision in expression identification

## Complexity Distribution:
- **Strategy Collection**: 10 domains, 372 strategies, 8,844 essential feature terms
- **Linguistic Analysis**: 30 representational areas, hundreds of references per concept
- **Draft Theories**: 892 axioms requiring systematic reorganization and refinement
- **Final Implementation**: 16 background + 29 psychology theories with consistent notation

## Conceptual Importance:
This chapter establishes the **methodological foundation** for large-scale knowledge representation in commonsense psychology. The successive formalization approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between coverage and competency that has hindered the field. By prioritizing breadth first, then systematically increasing formalization rigor, the methodology enables comprehensive domain coverage while achieving logical competency. This represents a paradigm shift from traditional approaches that sacrifice coverage for early competency.

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 1-2**: Provides methodological foundation for themes introduced in psychology and AI
- **Chapter 4**: Linguistic analysis directly feeds into vocabulary cataloging
- **Parts II-III**: Methodology produces the background and psychology theories formalized later
- **Applied Research**: Finite-state transducers enable corpus analysis applications

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Text Analysis**: Automatic annotation of commonsense psychology concepts in literature
- **Historical Analysis**: Tracking psychological concept evolution (e.g., unconscious desires pre/post-Freud)
- **Developmental Studies**: Children's acquisition of knowledge and belief reasoning
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced lexical resource for psychological concept recognition
- **Knowledge Engineering**: Repeatable methodology for other highly interdependent domains

## Notable Design Decisions:
- **Strategy-Based Evidence**: Using planning strategies as surrogate for naturally occurring analogies
- **Linguistic Grounding**: Comprehensive analysis of English psychological vocabulary
- **Productivity Over Rigor**: Initial focus on content generation rather than logical perfection
- **Incremental Refinement**: Four-stage process allowing systematic quality improvement
- **Community Integration**: Publishing intermediate results (finite-state transducers) for broader impact

## Theoretical Significance:
Chapter 3 presents a **revolutionary methodology** for knowledge representation that solves the coverage-competency dilemma plaguing the field. The successive formalization approach demonstrates that comprehensive domain coverage is achievable through systematic progression from informal to formal representations. The strategy-based evidence collection provides novel insights into human mental representation, while the linguistic analysis reveals the remarkable richness of psychological vocabulary. This methodology enables the creation of the comprehensive formal theories presented in subsequent parts of the book.

## Unique Contributions:

### **Methodological Innovation**:
- First systematic approach to achieve both coverage and competency in knowledge representation
- Novel use of planning strategies as evidence for mental representation structures
- Comprehensive linguistic methodology for concept identification and clustering

### **Empirical Insights**:
- Demonstration that 30 of 48 representational areas relate to commonsense psychology
- Evidence for systematic structure in human psychological reasoning across domains
- Quantitative analysis of English psychological vocabulary breadth and organization

### **Technological Advancement**:
- Advanced finite-state transducer technology for automatic psychological concept recognition
- Practical tools enabling large-scale corpus analysis of psychological language
- Repeatable methodology applicable to other complex knowledge domains

### **Theoretical Foundation**:
- Establishes formal basis for comprehensive commonsense psychology theory
- Bridges gap between informal psychological reasoning and formal logical representation
- Provides systematic approach to domain analysis that could transform knowledge engineering

This chapter represents a **methodological breakthrough** that makes the comprehensive formalization of commonsense psychology achievable for the first time, establishing both the theoretical foundation and practical tools necessary for the formal theories developed throughout the remainder of the book.
