# Chapter 9: Functions and sequences
- **19 axioms total** covering pairs, functions, and sequences
- **2 main sections**: Pairs and Functions, and Sequences
- **All background theory** - mathematical foundations

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Ordered Pairs**:
    - Axiom 9.1: Definition of pairs through existential quantification
    - Axiom 9.2: Structural properties (first, second elements)
    - Axioms 9.3-9.4: Equality and uniqueness properties

2. **Functions**:
    - Axiom 9.5: Complex definition of function0 as sets of pairs with constraints
    - Functions map from domain to range with unique values
    - Axioms 9.6-9.7: Domain and range definitions
    - Axiom 9.8: Function mapping (f(x) = y)
    - Axiom 9.9: Connection to Skolem functions from Chapter 7

3. **Sequences**:
    - Axiom 9.10: Integer intervals (sets of consecutive integers)
    - Axiom 9.11: Sequences as functions from {1,...,n} to any range
    - Axiom 9.12: Length definition
    - Axioms 9.13-9.14: nth and first element access
    - Axiom 9.15: Rest operation (sequence after removing first element)
    - Axioms 9.16-9.19: Last element, membership, ordering, and succession

4. **Mathematical Dependencies**:
    - References to positive integers, successor, leq, lt from Chapter 13
    - Builds on set theory from Chapter 6
    - Connects to Skolem functions from Chapter 7

5. **Complexity Distribution**:
    - Simple: 8 axioms (basic definitions and properties)
    - Moderate: 9 axioms (medium complexity definitions)
    - Complex: 2 axioms (function definition 9.5, sequence rest 9.15)

6. **Notable Features**:
    - Axiom 9.5 is particularly complex with multiple nested quantifiers
    - Overloaded predicates: `first` works for both pairs and sequences
    - Rich sequence operations for temporal/causal reasoning later

## Technical Notes:
- This chapter provides essential mathematical infrastructure
- Functions are defined set-theoretically as sets of ordered pairs
- Sequences enable temporal ordering and narrative structure
- The connection to Skolem functions bridges logic and mathematics
