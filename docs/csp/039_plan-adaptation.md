# Chapter 39: Plan Adaptation

- **10 axioms total** covering plan tweaking, adaptation processes, modification types, and adaptation outcomes including success and failure
- **3 main sections**: Tweaking, Types of Plan Adaptation, Outcomes of Plan Adaptation
- **Pure psychology** - comprehensive treatment of how agents modify existing plans to achieve new or similar goals through systematic adaptation processes

## Key Features Identified:

### 1. **Fundamental Tweaking Framework** (Axioms 39.1-39.4):

#### **Core Tweaking Definition**:
- **Axiom 39.1**: `tweak` - **complex plan step replacement**
  - Agent takes plan p1 for goal g1 and forms plan p2 for similar goal g2
  - Replaces one step e1 with similar step e2, yielding adapted plan
  - Restaurant example: paying before eating vs. after - retrieve standard plan and tweak event order
  - Foundation for all plan adaptation through similarity-based step substitution
  - Complex nested quantification over plan changes, envisioning, and similarity relations

#### **Plan Adaptation as Tweaking Sequence**:
- **Axiom 39.2**: `planAdaptation` - **complex systematic adaptation**
  - Planning activity where every step is a tweak
  - Produces sequence s of partial plans from p1 to p2
  - Systematic transformation through successive tweaking operations
  - Integration of planning activity with plan modification processes
  - Foundation for understanding adaptation as structured cognitive process

#### **Plan Retrieval and Context**:
- **Axiom 39.3**: `retrievePlan` - **simple memory access**
  - First step of adaptation: retrieving source plan from memory
  - "Remember how to," "consider an approach," "recall a technique," "pull from the playbook"
  - Plans can be previously executed, just thought through, or from other agents
  - Foundation for adaptation starting with existing causal knowledge
- **Axiom 39.4**: `modifyCurrentlyExecutingPlan` - **simple current plan modification**
  - Adaptation of plan currently being executed (thePlan from Chapter 31)
  - Real-time plan modification during execution
  - Integration with ongoing behavioral control systems

### 2. **Adaptation Type Taxonomy** (Axioms 39.5-39.7):

#### **Temporal Context Classification**:
- **Axiom 39.5**: `futurePlanModification` - **simple future plan adaptation**
  - Adaptation of plans not yet begun to be executed
  - Starting goal g1 not subgoal in current plan
  - Proactive planning modification before execution begins

#### **Parameter Modification Types**:
- **Axiom 39.6**: `modifyPlanValue` - **complex value-based adaptation**
  - Changing values in plans: "use more," "do it with more," "try increasing," "correct for"
  - Same external entity v at different points x1 and x2 in system s
  - Quantitative plan adjustment through parameter modification
  - Uses at' relations for positional value changes
- **Axiom 39.7**: `modifyPlanAgency` - **moderate agent substitution**
  - Changing agent who executes plan: "stand in for," "play the role of," "what would Jesus do?"
  - Extension from own previous plans to plans of others
  - Agent substitution using substitution framework from Chapter 7
  - Foundation for perspective-taking and role-based planning

### 3. **Adaptation Outcome Framework** (Axioms 39.8-39.10):

#### **Cost Analysis**:
- **Axiom 39.8**: `adaptationCost` - **simple effort measurement**
  - Number of substitutions needed in plan p1 to arrive at p2
  - Each substitution = one step in envisioning process
  - "Difficult to apply," "complex application of," "straightforward modification"
  - Foundation for effort-based adaptation decisions
  - Crude but tractable cost model for adaptation evaluation

#### **Success and Failure Conditions**:
- **Axiom 39.9**: `successfulAdaptation` - **simple success criteria**
  - New plan created that is executable by agent
  - "Successful application of," "thoroughly reworked the plan"
  - Integration with executability and constraint satisfaction
  - Temporal anchoring with Now and constraint world understanding
- **Axiom 39.10**: `failedAdaptation` - **simple failure definition**
  - No executable plan can be created from source plan
  - "Not applicable here," "unsalvageable plan," "not serve one's purposes"
  - Recognition of adaptation limits and source plan inadequacy

## Technical Sophistication:
- **Similarity-Based Adaptation**: Central role of similarity relations between goals and plan steps in all modification processes
- **Systematic Tweaking Framework**: Every adaptation step defined as similarity-preserving plan element replacement
- **Multi-Type Modification**: Comprehensive taxonomy covering value changes, agent substitution, and temporal context
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Formal treatment of adaptation effort vs. from-scratch planning alternatives
- **Success/Failure Conditions**: Clear criteria for adaptation outcomes based on executability
- **Reified Activities**: Strategic use of primed predicates for plan modification processes and memory retrieval
- **Integration with Planning Theory**: Deep connections to basic planning, envisioning, and substitution frameworks

## Complexity Distribution:
- **Simple**: 6 axioms (memory retrieval, temporal context, cost analysis, success/failure conditions)
- **Moderate**: 1 axiom (agent substitution with substitution framework integration)
- **Complex**: 3 axioms (core tweaking, systematic adaptation, value modification with positional relations)

## Conceptual Importance:
This chapter provides crucial infrastructure for:
- **Adaptive Planning**: Systematic reuse of existing plans for new but similar situations
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: Avoiding from-scratch planning when adaptation is more efficient
- **Cross-Context Transfer**: Applying plans across different agents, values, and situations
- **Plan Reuse**: Leveraging accumulated planning knowledge through modification rather than recreation
- **Effort Management**: Cost-based decisions between adaptation and new plan construction
- **Real-Time Modification**: Adapting plans during execution when circumstances change

## Cross-Chapter Connections:
- **Chapter 31 (Plans)**: Uses basic plan structure, thePlan for current execution, and subgoal relationships
- **Chapter 38 (Plan Construction)**: Adaptation as alternative to from-scratch planning construction
- **Chapter 24 (Envisioning)**: Adaptation as envisioning process with substitution steps
- **Chapter 22 (Similarity)**: Similarity relations fundamental to all tweaking operations
- **Chapter 7 (Substitution)**: Substitution framework for agent replacement and parameter modification
- **Chapter 36 (Planning Modalities)**: Planning activities extended with adaptation-specific operations

## Applications Mentioned:
- **Restaurant Adaptation**: Standard restaurant plan adapted for pay-before vs. pay-after establishments
- **Performance Strategies**: Choir nervousness control (focus on conductor) adapted to lecture anxiety (focus on friendly face)
- **Activity Parameter Changes**: Movie plan modifications (different movie, theater, friend, driver, time)
- **Effort Examples**: One-handed to two-handed object lifting, "use more," "try increasing," "correct for"
- **Role Substitution**: "Stand in for," "play the role of," "fill in for," "what would Jesus do?"
- **Plan Retrieval**: "Remember how to," "pull from the playbook," "recall a technique"

## Notable Design Decisions:
- **Similarity-Centered Framework**: All adaptation based on similarity preservation between goals and plan steps
- **Tweaking as Atomic Operation**: Single step replacement as fundamental unit of adaptation
- **No Defeasible Rules**: All adaptation processes defined as strict logical relationships
- **Cost-Effectiveness Integration**: Explicit consideration of adaptation effort vs. from-scratch alternatives
- **Multi-Parameter Modification**: Systematic treatment of value, agent, and temporal parameter changes
- **Success/Failure Dichotomy**: Clear executability-based criteria for adaptation outcomes
- **Memory Integration**: Plan retrieval as explicit first step in adaptation process

## Theoretical Significance:
Chapter 39 addresses the fundamental cognitive challenge of plan reuse through systematic modification. The similarity-based tweaking framework captures how agents leverage existing planning knowledge by making minimal changes to achieve new but related goals, representing a crucial efficiency mechanism in human cognition.

The comprehensive adaptation taxonomy from simple value changes through agent substitution demonstrates the flexibility of human planning systems in transferring knowledge across contexts. The "what would Jesus do?" example illustrates sophisticated perspective-taking where agents adapt others' plans by substituting themselves into different roles.

The cost analysis framework acknowledges that adaptation is not always more efficient than from-scratch planning, requiring agents to evaluate effort trade-offs. The envisioning-based cost model (substitutions as envisioning steps) provides tractable foundations for such evaluations.

The success/failure framework with executability criteria recognizes that not all plans can be successfully adapted to new contexts, requiring agents to recognize adaptation limits and fall back to alternative planning approaches.

The integration of adaptation with ongoing plan execution (modifyCurrentlyExecutingPlan) captures the dynamic nature of planning where agents must modify their approach in real-time as circumstances change during goal pursuit.

The chapter's 10 axioms establish plan adaptation as a sophisticated cognitive architecture involving memory retrieval, similarity-based modification, cost evaluation, and success assessment, representing one of the most comprehensive formal treatments of plan reuse in cognitive science.

This provides both psychological plausibility for human planning efficiency and computational foundations for adaptive planning systems that must reuse and modify existing solutions rather than constantly planning from scratch.
