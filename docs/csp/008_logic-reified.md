# Chapter 8: Logic reified
- **13 axioms total** covering reified logical operators
- **3 main sections**: Conjunction, Negation, and Disjunction and Implication
- **All background theory** - foundational logical machinery

## Key Features Identified:

1. **Reified Logic**:
    - Standard logical operators (and, or, not, imply) are treated as first-class predicates
    - Primed versions (and', or', not', imply') are the basic reified forms
    - This allows logical relationships to be objects of thought and belief

2. **Modal Existence**:
    - Heavy use of `Rexist` predicate to handle when logical combinations actually hold
    - Axiom 8.1: Conjunction exists when both conjuncts exist
    - Axiom 8.3: Negation exists when the negated thing doesn't exist
    - Axiom 8.6: Disjunction exists when at least one disjunct exists

3. **Type vs Token Distinction**:
    - Axiom 8.4 introduces `nott'` for negating eventuality types rather than tokens
    - Important for handling contextual negation in natural language

4. **Set Extensions**:
    - Axiom 8.2: Sets exist when all members exist (conjunction interpretation)
    - Axiom 8.7: Disjunction extended to sets of eventualities
    - Axiom 8.8: Implications can take sets as antecedents

5. **Inference Rules**:
    - Axiom 8.10: Modus ponens for reified implications
    - Axiom 8.11: Transitivity of implication
    - Axiom 8.12: Definition of inconsistent sets
    - Axiom 8.13: Minimal proof relationship

6. **Complexity Distribution**:
    - Simple: 3 axioms (basic inference rules, type constraints)
    - Moderate: 10 axioms (most of the logical definitions)
    - Complex: 0 axioms (relatively straightforward chapter)

## Notable Features:
- This chapter bridges formal logic and commonsense reasoning
- The reified logical operators enable reasoning about logical relationships as objects
- Essential foundation for belief, knowledge, and reasoning chapters that follow
- Careful handling of the type/token distinction for contextual interpretation
