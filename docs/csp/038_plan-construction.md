## Theoretical Significance:
Chapter 38 addresses the fundamental challenge of how agents actually construct plans from initial goals through final candidate selection. The distinction between planning by instantiation (using familiar scripts) and planning from scratch (creative construction using causal knowledge) captures essential differences in human planning behavior.

The comprehensive process control framework acknowledges that planning is not a linear process but involves suspension, resumption, restart, and abortion as circumstances change. The modular construction operations provide systematic foundations for understanding how plans develop through specification, subplan addition/removal, precondition identification, alternative selection, and temporal ordering.

The obstacle management framework integrates impediment theory with planning problem identification, enabling systematic approach to problem-solving during plan construction. The rational candidate selection process provides foundations for understanding how agents choose among multiple possible plans through assessment and optimization.

The integration of planning construction with process control, obstacle management, and rational selection creates a comprehensive framework for understanding planning as a complex cognitive process involving multiple interacting components rather than simple goal-to-action transformation.

The chapter's 26 axioms establish plan construction as sophisticated cognitive architecture involving script instantiation, creative construction, process management, problem solving, and rational decision making under uncertainty.

This represents one of the most comprehensive formal treatments of planning construction processes in cognitive science, providing both psychological plausibility for human planning behavior and computational foundations for automated planning systems that must construct, control, and select plans under realistic constraints.
